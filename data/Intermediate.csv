Cranberry-pear pie with crumble topping,Recipe adapted from Sally’s Baking Addiction,https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/cranberry-pear-crumble-pie/,"<p>This recipe uses a homemade pie crust but is topped with a crumble topping, so it doesn’t require a fancy lattice crust. Cranberry and pear make a tasty fall combination. </p>","9-inch pie pan, oven, measuring cups, mixing bowls, rolling pin, vegetable peeler, something to mix your pie crust with (food processor, high-powered blender or pastry cutter)",2 1/2,cups all-purpose flour,6,"cups ripe pears, cut into half-inch chunks (about 5 pears)",5,tablespoons unsalted butter,<b>1. </b>Cut your sticks of butter into small cubes roughly half an inch wide. Put them in the freezer.,"<b>1. </b>After the crust has chilled for at least an hour, pull it out of the refrigerator. Put the pie pan in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 350 F.","Keeping all your ingredients chilled is key to a flaky pie dough. You should see small pieces of butter in your dough, and your butter should not melt. If your ingredients are getting warm as you mix, particularly if mixing by hand, stick them all in the freezer for 5 minutes and then continue.","<p>To make a gluten-free pie, make a gluten-free crust (see below) and substitute a gluten-free flour in the filling and crumble topping.</p>

<p>For gluten-free pie crust, use a 1-to-1 gluten-free baking flour, like Bob’s Red Mill or King Arthur Flour. (Make sure your flour includes xanthan gum, which will help the dough stick together without gluten.)</p>

<p>Follow the same process to make your pie dough, but with these ingredients:</p>",3,cups all-purpose gluten-free flour,"<p>Add the egg to the dough before you add the water, and add the baking powder to the flour/salt mixture. Otherwise, the process is exactly the same.</p>

<p>You can make your gluten-free pie dough a little more moist, because it will absorb more water as it chills. It’s also helpful to use the dough soon after making it (after at least 30 minutes of refrigeration), or it will get hard and take longer to soften and roll out.</p>"

Make the cranberry-pear filling. </b>In a large bowl, combine the pear chunks, cranberries, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, ginger and lemon juice. Stir with a large spoon or spatula until well combined.","Rolling out pie dough can be tricky: It needs to be cold enough that the butter doesn’t melt, but soft enough to be pliable. If the dough is too hard or crumbles as you roll it out, let it sit at room temperature for 15 more minutes and try again. If the dough is too sticky or starts to feel greasy, put it in the refrigerator for 5 minutes.",,1,cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter,

The dough should be softer than it was in the refrigerator, but still cold. Sprinkle flour on your hands, rolling pin and work surface (I like rolling crust out on a silicone baking mat for easy cleanup). Turn the dough a quarter-turn every few rolls and make sure it’s not sticking to the counter. Roll until you have a rough circle that’s 12 inches in diameter. ",,,1,"egg, beaten and chilled",

Test the consistency of the dough: It should be moist enough to stick together when you pinch it, but it shouldn’t be wet. If it’s still dry and crumbly, add another tablespoon of the water mixture and pulse 5 more times; continue until the dough is moist but not sticky. ","<b>5. </b>Carefully place the rolled-out pie dough into the chilled pie pan. Gently press the center and edges into the pan and use a knife to trim off any dough hanging over the edge of the pan. Don’t stretch the dough, though, or it will shrink while baking. Chill the pan for 30 minutes.",,,1/2,teaspoon salt,
