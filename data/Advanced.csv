Berry-ginger pie with spoke lattice crust,"Technique adapted from “Pieometry” by Lauren Ko (William Morrow Cookbooks, 2020, $32.50)",https://www.lokokitchen.com/pieometry,"<p>Ready to take your pie to the next level and wow your holiday gathering? It’s time to use a beautiful spoke lattice technique created by Seattle’s own Lauren Ko, author of “Pieometry.” Mixed berries will make this design pop, and a dash of fresh ginger adds holiday warmth.</p>","9-inch pie pan, oven, measuring cups, mixing bowls, rolling pin, ruler, pizza cutter, 2-inch circle cutter, something to mix your pie crust with (food processor, high-powered blender or pastry cutter)",2 1/2,cups all-purpose flour,6,"cups fresh blackberries, raspberries, strawberries or blueberries (your choice on the berries and proportions; you just need 6 cups total)",1,egg white,<b>1. </b>Cut your sticks of butter into small cubes roughly half an inch wide. Put them in the freezer.,"<b>1. </b>After the crust has chilled for at least an hour, pull it out of the refrigerator. Put the pie pan in the refrigerator.","<p>Keeping all your ingredients chilled is key to a flaky pie dough. You should see small pieces of butter in your dough, and your butter should not melt. If your ingredients are getting warm as you mix, particularly if mixing by hand, stick them all in the freezer for 5 minutes and then continue.</p>

<p>Rolling out pie dough can be tricky: It needs to be cold enough that the butter doesn’t melt, but soft enough to be pliable. If the dough is too hard or crumbles as you roll it out, let it sit at room temperature for 15 more minutes and try again. If the dough is too sticky or starts to feel greasy, put it in the refrigerator for 5 minutes.</p>","<p>For a gluten-free pie, make a gluten-free crust (see below) and substitute a gluten-free flour in the filling. Gluten-free dough can be harder to make a lattice crust with; be patient and gently brush ice water on your dough if it gets too crumbly.</p>

<p>For gluten-free pie crust, use a 1-to-1 gluten-free baking flour, like Bob’s Red Mill or King Arthur Flour. (Make sure your flour includes xanthan gum, which will help the dough stick together without gluten.)</p>

<p>Follow the same process to make your pie dough, but with these ingredients:</p>",3,cups all-purpose gluten-free flour,"<p>Add the egg to the dough before you add the water, and add the baking powder to the flour/salt mixture. Otherwise, the process is exactly the same.</p>

<p>You can make your gluten-free pie dough a little more moist, because it will absorb more water as it chills. It’s also helpful to use the dough soon after making it (after at least 30 minutes of refrigeration), or it will get hard and take longer to soften and roll out.</p>"
